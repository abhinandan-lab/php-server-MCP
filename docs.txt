Migration :
We need better way of migrating tables with error check and all

--------------

New vue js api/docs:
Dashboard with multiple options

1) api testing 
2) services testing 
3) repository testing
4) curl runner 
5) metrixs
6) settings 
7) workingTime

In the dashboard there will be a button which will toggle debugmode, show errors, log errors


Curl runner should show a option to copy prompt and generate the curl commands which can be directly pasted into the curl runner


Similarly service tester, controllers tester, repository tester should have copy prompt option


Settings: we can use this to manage other env variables and other framework settings 

Database connections through env or settings


In api testing we can use database.table.column_name in writing api routes this help us populate the real value not just  useless dummies


This will show the Stop watch timer from howmuch time we were working 

------------------------

Runquery:
There should be a class which handles connection pooling 



Runquery function should automatically should applies pagination it can be off when set to false

Return sqlquery should be build with parameters 

We will use repository pattern in

------------

Important features to implement :
Write do controllers as I know everything in that code
Use the docs controller html style with little variations for service testing controller 
All helpers and services should be automatically included no need to add them
Similarly for helpers controllers 
Feature to add which calculated time and resource consumed during execution
If possible movie all system folders to core folder so the folders which are required by user they only visible at the root api/*
controllers/*
helpers/*
services/*
core/*
repository/*
We need to add watcher which will show the state on every reload or request to notify what is happening 
Also we can integrate live server which will refresh the html page when we do changes in php files not so important 
We can implement mermaid diagram flow in docscontroller and servicetester to see directly logical flow of the APIs endpoint and services tester functions 
To improve performance consider implementing op cache configuration redis memcached caching database connection pooling and response compression
Need to add transaction handling and connection pooling and automatically fetch paginated rows
We will create two types of middleware one will group end points  based on the router first keyword(/api/* , /api2/*) and other will group inside it routes based on authentications.   This way we can properly reuse authentication codes
We will use pgBouncer for connection pooling


----------

Services:

Now we should use services class to keep the clean code and scalable

Writing all the business logic here with database queries 


And getting request validating inputs sending response we should do in controllers 


But managing entities updating them we should services so that by using this we can use it anywhere we want 


When writing services keep in mind that it should be testable 

-----------------
New featurs in framework:
Our framework also should follow the key value pair inputs in routes, helpers we can skip controller functions
PHASE 2
api/tables --> this should be a folder and inside it we can write as many tables list 
The migration should be able to handle multiple file tables migration

-----------------

MCP tools :
 Sql Table generotor with proper comments
Should know or have list of available helpers
Should be able create/edit/ routes in index.php
Also should be able to create/adit controller functions
Should be able to edit and update helper funcions or extend the existing 



-------------


DocsController :
provide a link for documentations
PHASE 2
Need to make nice colors of docsController 
Collapse all - toggle  button to make all section collapse
The tags list should be declare in index.php
group tags button lists are not available | when user clicks on this button it should take us to that group
There should be a link where it will list all the helper functions and their descriptions and way to test them 
Docscontroller should be able to use files in the tsting api blocks
/docs should also show the curl command so that curl command is available at that moment 
In /docs we can use clear and automatically fill option so the testing could be very smooth

----------------

Framework Best Practises :
We have to write the documentation in a way that it encourages user to use best practises of this framework 
When writing tables for migration write comments explaining the use and reason and the relation with other tables
Use of pp and ppp wherever needed for debugging
Using docsController  and its related tools
All helper functions should use key value parameters so that extending them should not be painfull
Always use available sanitizion and input validation framework function
Always use sendResponse function so the code can be in uniformity
Writing bunch of helpers for every kind of task is annoying instead use private functions related to controller 
The helper function should be like common function can be used anywhere 
All the helpers should be placed inside the helpers/* folder
